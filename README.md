# Animated Lithophane
A 3d printed, animated lithophane featuring Carlton from The Fresh Prince of Bel Air dancing.

It can be adjusted to display whatever video/gif you like. 
You will have to make an image up (see Carlton images as template) and generate a lithophane using [Lithophane Maker](https://lithophanemaker.com/)

## Hardware used:
* 2x 61806 bearings for main carrige
* 2x 6901 bearings for handle shaft pivot
* 1x 618/8 bearing for handle
* 1x 24V LED strip
* 1x Sharp GP1A57HRJ00F photo interupter
* 1x generic n-channel mosfet for LED switching

## Notes:
* The trigger ring didn't work properly for me when printed in white. When I used black, it worked perfectly.
* I printed everything at 0.15 mm layer height except for the lithophane itself which I printed at 0.10 mm layer height.
* You don't need all the bearings I used, it just makes it run smoother. You would have to adjust the design if you weren't using them though.
